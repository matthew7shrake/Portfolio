# Matthew Shrake - Portfolio

# <small>
My name is Matthew Shrake, and I am a student at Brandeis University pursuing a Master of Science degree in Business Analytics with a concentration in Sports Analytics. In this program, I am rapidly advancing my abilities in Python, R, SQL, and more. I have also co-founded a Sports Analytics Club to heighten my engagement in the discipline.

Originally from Chicago, Illinois, I received my Bachelor of Arts degree from Bates College, majoring in economics, majoring in history, and minoring in digital and computational studies. On campus at Bates, my primary involvements included competing as a pitcher on the baseball team, serving as president of the Catholic Student Community, and leading the Investment Club as president.

I have completed valuable summer internships in the workforce that have sharpened my well-rounded skill set. I am primarily passionate about furthering my knowledge with data and research in sports, most notably in baseball.
